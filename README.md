# DC-Motor-Control-using-Arduino-and-L293D-Motor-Driver
This project demonstrates how to control 4 DC motors connected to an Arduino UNO using the L293D motor driver. The motors perform specific movements based on the task requirements, including forward, backward, and alternating left and right.

## **Features**
- üöÄ **Forward Movement**: All motors move forward for 30 seconds.
- üîÑ **Backward Movement**: All motors move backward for 1 minute.
- ‚¨ÖÔ∏è‚û°Ô∏è **Alternating Turns**: Motors alternate between right and left turns for 1 minute.
- üí° **Flexible Design**: Modular code structure for easy expansion and maintenance.

## **Code Overview**

The code consists of:

1. **Pin Definitions:**
   Each motor's enable and control pins are defined for clarity.

2. **Setup Function:**
   Initializes all motor pins as outputs and stops all motors initially.

3. **Loop Function:**
   Executes the following sequence:
   - Move forward for 30 seconds.
   - Move backward for 1 minute.
   - Alternate between right and left turns for 1 minute.

4. **Motor Control Functions:**
   - `moveForward()`
   - `moveBackward()`
   - `turnRight()`
   - `turnLeft()`
   - `stopMotors()`
   - `alternateRightLeft()`

## **How to Run**

1. üõ†Ô∏è **Set up the Circuit:**
   - Follow the circuit diagram and connect all components correctly.

2. üñ•Ô∏è **Upload the Code:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE.
   - Copy the code into a new sketch.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino UNO.

3. üîã **Power the Circuit:**
   - Ensure the Arduino is powered via USB or an external source.
   - Use the 9V battery to power the motors through the motor driver.

4. üé• **Observe the Movements:**
   - Motors will perform the forward, backward, and alternating turn movements as per the task requirements.
